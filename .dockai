[analyzer]
This is a CLI tool (not a web service) that is installed via pip and run via the `dockai` command.
It does NOT expose any HTTP ports or health endpoints.
The application type is "cli" not "service".

[generator]
Do NOT include EXPOSE directives - this is a CLI tool.
Do NOT include health checks - this is a CLI tool that exits after running.
Do NOT run pytest during the build process.
Install the package using: pip install --no-cache-dir .
The entry point should be: ["dockai", "--help"] to verify installation works.
Use a single-stage build since this is a simple Python package.
