# DockAI 🐳🤖
> **The Universal AI DevOps Architect for Dockerizing Applications**

DockAI is a powerful, agentic CLI tool that autonomously generates, validates, and optimizes production-ready Dockerfiles for **ANY** application. 

Unlike simple template generators, DockAI acts as a **Universal DevOps Architect**. It uses a stateful, cyclic workflow to reason from first principles, allowing it to containerize not just standard stacks (Node, Python, Go) but also legacy systems and **future technologies** it has never seen before.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Universal Agentic Brain
- **First-Principles Reasoning**: Doesn't rely on hardcoded templates. It analyzes file extensions, shebangs, and build scripts to deduce how to build and run *any* code.
- **Future-Proof**: Can handle unknown or future programming languages by analyzing their runtime requirements (e.g., "This looks like a new compiled language, I need to install its toolchain").
- **Strategic Planning**: Acts as an Architect, planning the build strategy (multi-stage, static linking, security hardening) before writing code.

### 🔄 Self-Correcting Workflow
- **Automated Debugging**: If the build fails, DockAI doesn't just give up. It performs a "Post-Mortem" analysis, reads the error logs, understands the root cause (e.g., "missing system library `libxyz`"), and **fixes its own code**.
- **Iterative Improvement**: It learns from each attempt, refining the Dockerfile until it passes all validation checks.

### 🛡️ Robust Validation & Security
- **Sandboxed Verification**: Every generated Dockerfile is built and run in a secure, resource-limited sandbox.
- **Smart Health Checks**: 
    - Automatically detects health endpoints (e.g., `/health`).
    - **Robust Fallback**: Checks from inside the container first, but falls back to host-based checks for secure "distroless" images that lack `curl`.
- **Readiness Detection**: Uses AI to predict startup log patterns (e.g., "Server ready on port 8080") to intelligently wait for the app to start.
- **Security First**: Proactively plans for non-root users, pinned versions, and minimal base images. Integrated with **Trivy** for vulnerability scanning.

### 💎 Developer Experience
- **Beautiful UI**: Powered by `Rich`, featuring real-time status spinners, formatted logs, and clear error reports.
- **Cost Awareness**: Tracks and reports token usage for every stage.
- **Production Ready**: Generates optimized, multi-stage Dockerfiles following industry best practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

DockAI is built on **LangGraph**, enabling a cyclic, stateful workflow that mimics a human engineer's problem-solving process. It is not a linear script but a **State Machine** that can loop back, change strategies, and learn from mistakes.

### The Agentic Workflow

The agent moves through a sophisticated graph of nodes, maintaining a shared `DockAIState` that accumulates knowledge, plans, and error history.

#### 1. 📂 Scanner (`scanner.py`)
*   **Behavior**: Acts as the "eyes" of the agent.
*   **Intelligence**: Respects `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to avoid sending irrelevant files (like `node_modules` or `venv`) to the LLM, saving tokens and reducing noise.
*   **Output**: A compressed file tree representation.

#### 2. 🧠 Analyzer (`analyzer.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Brain" that reasons from first principles.
*   **Intelligence**: Instead of looking for hardcoded file names, it analyzes file extensions, shebangs (`#!/bin/...`), and build scripts to deduce the technology stack.
*   **Universal Capability**: Can identify "unknown" stacks (e.g., a new language released tomorrow) by recognizing it needs a compiler or interpreter based on file signatures.

#### 3. 📖 Reader (`nodes.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Researcher".
*   **Intelligence**: Selectively reads only the files identified as "critical" by the Analyzer. Uses "Head & Tail" truncation for large files to fit within context windows while preserving imports and main functions.

#### 4. 🏥 & ⏱️ Detectors (`nodes.py`)
*   **Health Detector**: Scans code for HTTP routes like `/health`, `/status`, or `/ping`.
*   **Readiness Detector**: Analyzes logging statements to predict what the app will print when it's ready (e.g., "Server listening on port 3000"). This allows the Validator to wait intelligently rather than sleeping for a fixed time.

#### 5. 📝 Planner (`agent.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Architect".
*   **Intelligence**: Before writing code, it formulates a `BuildPlan`.
    *   **Base Image Selection**: Verifies tags against real registries to prevent hallucinations.
    *   **Strategy**: Decides between Multi-stage builds (for compiled languages) or Slim images (for interpreted ones).
    *   **Security**: Plans for non-root users and minimal attack surfaces.

#### 6. ⚙️ Generator (`generator.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Builder".
*   **Intelligence**: Writes the `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` based on the Architect's plan. If this is a retry, it incorporates "Lessons Learned" from previous failures to avoid repeating mistakes.

#### 7. 🔒 Security Reviewer (`reviewer.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Security Engineer".
*   **Intelligence**: Performs a static analysis *before* the build. If it finds critical issues (like running as root or exposed secrets), it rejects the Dockerfile and sends it back to the Generator with specific fix instructions.

#### 8. ✅ Validator (`validator.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "QA Engineer".
*   **Process**:
    1.  **Builds** the image in a sandboxed environment.
    2.  **Runs** a container with memory/CPU limits.
    3.  **Waits** for the "Readiness Pattern" detected earlier.
    4.  **Probes** the "Health Endpoint" (falling back to host-port checks if `curl` is missing inside the container).
    5.  **Scans** the final image with **Trivy** for CVEs.

#### 9. 🤔 Reflector (`agent.py`)
*   **Behavior**: The "Debugger".
*   **Intelligence**: This is the core of the agent's resilience. When validation fails, it:
    *   Reads the build logs or runtime errors.
    *   Classifies the error (e.g., "Missing System Dependency", "Wrong Entrypoint").
    *   **Updates the Plan**: If the strategy was wrong (e.g., used Alpine but needed Glibc), it instructs the Planner to switch base images.
    *   **Loops Back**: Triggers a new generation cycle with this new knowledge.

## 📝 Custom Instructions

You can customize DockAI's behavior by providing instructions through:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `DOCKAI_ANALYZER_INSTRUCTIONS` and/or `DOCKAI_GENERATOR_INSTRUCTIONS`.
2. **A `.dockai` file** in your project root.

### `.dockai` File Format

```ini
[analyzer]
# Instructions for the analysis phase
Focus on identifying microservices architecture.
Look for any .env.example files to understand environment variables.

[generator]
# Instructions for the Dockerfile generation phase
Use Alpine-based images where possible.
Define an environment variable 'APP_ENV' with value 'production'.
```

If no sections are specified, the instructions apply to both phases.
